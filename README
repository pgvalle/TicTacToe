TicTacToe:
    This is a simple implementation of a tictactoe game.

How to build:
    You only need to run "make" in your shell. Or use cmake.

How to Play:
    Use the numpad Keys:
        7 8 9
        4 5 6
        1 2 3
    
    And 2 players are needed to play this one
    because I didn't implement a Player vs. CPU mode.

PLEASE READ THIS:
    Jesus loves you and wants to help, protect, bring happiness and save us from hell.
    Give him the chance. Give yourself the chance!
