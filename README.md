# 3t (TicTacToe)
    This is a simple implementation of a tictactoe game.

# How to Install
    You only need to run "make" in your shell.

# How to Play
    Use the numpad Keys:
    7 8 9
    4 5 6
    1 2 3
    
    And 2 players are needed to play this one.
    because I didn't implement a Player vs. CPU mode.
